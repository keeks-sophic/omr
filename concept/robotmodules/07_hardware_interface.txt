MODULE 07: HARDWARE INTERFACE (DRIVERS + SAFETY)
========================================================

Goal:
- Provide a clean driver boundary for motors, radar, QR, actuators
- Convert hardware events into state events

Inputs:
- Drive setpoints from Motion Control
- Actuator commands from Command Handling

Outputs:
- Sensor events:
  - radar obstacle detection
  - QR scans
  - motor fault signals
  - estop status
- Actuator feedback:
  - hoist/telescope/rotate positions, grip state

Logic:
- Hardware drivers never talk to NATS.
- Drivers emit events to StateStore and Telemetry module.
- Safety interlocks can override Motion Control requests (hard stop).
