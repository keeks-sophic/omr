1. What should be implement
- Route assignment/update ingestion and active route tracking
- Route progress computation and periodic reporting
- Task lifecycle events (completed/failed) and acknowledgements

2. What have been implement
- RouteInbox queues route messages; TaskInbox queues task control/assignment
- RouteProgressTracker.ComputeProgress returns minimal progress data (segment index, distance)
- TaskRouteExecutor.Tick computes progress and publishes route.progress; TaskCompleted/TaskFailed publish task.event
- CommandListenerService AcceptRouteAssign/Update maps contract segments to domain and applies RouteAssigned

3. How does it implement
- AcceptRouteAssign maps segments, stores ActiveRoute, publishes state.event for changes
- PeriodicScheduler triggers TaskRouteExecutor.Tick at TickOptions.RouteSeconds cadence
- TelemetryService.PublishRouteProgress publishes progress subjects; Task events emitted via PublishTaskEvent

4. How the flow works between frontend, backend, robot, db
- Backend sends route.assign/update; robot computes and publishes route.progress and task.event
- No direct frontend or database integration

5. Does it communicate with db, if yes what is the data model used
- No

6. Does it communicate with robot, if yes what is the natsjetstream endpoint used
- Subscribe: route.assign, route.update, task.control
- Publish: route.progress, task.event

7. Does it communicate with frontend, if yes what is the websocket or api endpoint used
- No direct frontend communication

8. What have not be implemented
- Real progress computation (odometry/path following, checkpoint handling)
- Route update application effects beyond queuing
- Task executor integration with motion/path planner

9. Requirements not implemented (per robotconcept)
- Progress event standardization with actor/target/outcome fields
- Failure reason taxonomy and retry policies
- Durable event emission and backpressure handling

10. Endpoints and compliance
- NATS: route.assign/update/progress, task.event
- Matches rbnats: Yes (subject names), payloads are currently stubbed
