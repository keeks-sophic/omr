1. What should be implement
- Canonical contracts for commands, tasks, routes, telemetry, presence, logs
- Subject naming conventions and grouping for robot-specific streams
- Separation of backend→robot and robot→backend subjects

2. What have been implement
- Contracts under Contracts/*: Commands (Grip/Hoist/Telescope/CamToggle/Rotate/Mode), Tasks (Assignment/Control/Event), Routes (Assign/Update/Progress), Telemetry (Battery/Health/Pose/Motion/Radar/Qr), Presence (Hello/Heartbeat), Logs (Event), DTOs for state and capabilities
- NatsSubjects centralizes subject naming for cmd/task/route/cfg/traffic/presence/state/telemetry/log/rpc
- TelemetryService and PresencePublisher use NatsSubjects to publish
- CommandListenerService registers subscriptions based on NatsSubjects

3. How does it implement
- NatsSubjects provides Robot(robotId, suffix) and typed helpers to derive per-robot subjects
- RobotWorker registers publishers and subscriptions upon startup
- Services and workers publish to subjects via NatsService.Publish and subscribe via NatsService.Subscribe

4. How the flow works between frontend, backend, robot, db
- Backend emits commands/tasks/routes/config/traffic to robot subjects; robot consumes
- Robot publishes ack/state/route progress/telemetry/logs to backend; backend consumes
- No frontend/websocket on robot side; no database writes

5. Does it communicate with db, if yes what is the data model used
- No

6. Does it communicate with robot, if yes what is the natsjetstream endpoint used
- Backend→Robot: cmd.grip/hoist/telescope/cam_toggle/rotate/mode, task.assign/control, route.assign/update, cfg.motion_limits/runtime_mode/features, traffic.schedule, rpc.ping/get_state/get_versions
- Robot→Backend: presence.hello/heartbeat, cmd_ack, state.snapshot/event, task.event, route.progress, telemetry.battery/health/pose/motion/radar/qr, log.event

7. Does it communicate with frontend, if yes what is the websocket or api endpoint used
- No direct frontend communication

8. What have not be implemented
- Contract payload serialization and validation in publishers/subscribers
- Versioning and schema evolution for contracts
- RPC request/response plumbing beyond subject registration

9. Requirements not implemented (per robotconcept)
- Durable consumers and delivery guarantees per subject
- Unified envelope with correlation and trace IDs across all messages
- Backpressure and rate limiting policy

10. Endpoints and compliance
- Subject families defined under NatsSubjects.*
- Matches rbnats: Yes (subject families and per-robot suffixing)
