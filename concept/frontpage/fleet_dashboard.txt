Page: Fleet Dashboard

Concept:
- Single screen for fleet health and operational readiness
- Summarizes robot modes, incidents, tasks, and congestion

Accessible Functions:
- View robot tiles: mode, safetyStopReason, battery, connectivity, runtimeMode
- View active tasks: status, ETA, assigned robotId
- View incidents: radar stops, E_STOP, FAULT transitions, communication loss
- Acknowledge incidents (if available to role)
- Navigate to robot details and task details

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): GET /api/v1/robots, GET /api/v1/ops/health, GET /api/v1/ops/jetstream, GET /api/v1/ops/alerts
- REST (planned): GET /api/v1/fleet/incidents, POST /api/v1/fleet/incidents/{incidentId}/ack
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime
- SignalR topics: fleet.summary.snapshot, robot.session.updated, task.status.changed, traffic.overview.snapshot/updated, ops.alert.raised/cleared, ops.jetstream.updated

Backend Communication:
- Auth via JWT for REST and SignalR
- Subscribes to robots group and traffic overview topics; receives initial snapshot on subscribe
- Role-based filtering for visibility and actions; Operator/Admin can acknowledge incidents if policy allows
