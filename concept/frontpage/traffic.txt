Page: Traffic

Concept:
- Visualize live traffic overlays and per-robot schedule summaries
- Debug conflicts, holds, and congestion; apply operator holds

Accessible Functions:
- Live map overlay: robot positions, planned routes, conflict zones
- Visualize holds/stop windows and reservations; congestion heatmap
- Per-robot schedule view: target velocity timeline; holds/release markers; compare target vs actual speed
- Operator actions: request reroute; apply/remove temporary holds at node/path (role-based policy)

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): GET /api/v1/traffic/conflicts, POST /api/v1/traffic/holds, DELETE /api/v1/traffic/holds/{holdId}
- REST (planned): GET /api/v1/traffic/robots/{robotId}/schedule
- REST (implemented, planning): POST /api/v1/routes/plan (for reroute requests via Task/Route flow)
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime
- SignalR topics: traffic.overview.snapshot/updated, traffic.schedule.summary.updated, route.updated

Backend Communication:
- Auth via JWT; Planner/Admin may apply holds; Operators may request reroutes
- REST for conflict queries and hold management
- Subscribes to traffic overview and schedule summary topics; receives initial snapshot on subscribe
