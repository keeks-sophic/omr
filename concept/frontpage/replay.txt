Page: Replay

Concept:
- Incident review and playback of historical robot activity
- Visualize robot state timeline, telemetry overlays, task events, traffic summaries, and logs

Accessible Functions:
- Create replay session: pick robotId, time window, playback speed
- Controls: play, pause, seek
- Views: state timeline, telemetry overlays (pose/motion), task events + route progress, traffic schedule/holds summaries, logs and fault explanations

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): POST /api/v1/replay/sessions, POST /api/v1/replay/sessions/{replaySessionId}/start, POST /api/v1/replay/sessions/{replaySessionId}/stop, POST /api/v1/replay/sessions/{replaySessionId}/seek
- REST (planned): GET /api/v1/replay/sessions/{replaySessionId}
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime
- SignalR topics: replay.session.status, replay.event

Backend Communication:
- Auth via JWT; read-only access for Viewer and above
- REST for session lifecycle; SignalR streams events; initial snapshot on subscribe
- Replay data never publishes to live robot subjects; strictly read-only playback
