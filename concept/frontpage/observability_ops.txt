Page: Observability & Ops

Concept:
- Operational dashboards for health, alerts, audit, and log search
- Monitor JetStream health, heartbeat/offline detection, fault distribution, and ACK performance

Accessible Functions:
- View backend health and JetStream metrics
- View and filter ops alerts; acknowledge or clear (as supported)
- View audit logs of privileged actions
- Search logs across robots; export incident bundles (events + map version + mission version)

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): GET /api/v1/ops/health, GET /api/v1/ops/jetstream, GET /api/v1/ops/alerts, GET /api/v1/ops/audit
- REST (planned): GET /api/v1/robots/{robotId}/logs
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime
- SignalR topics: ops.alert.raised/cleared, ops.jetstream.updated

Backend Communication:
- Auth via JWT; role-based access governs visibility and actions
- REST for health/alerts/audit queries; realtime for streaming ops updates
- Incident bundles generated server-side and offered for export via REST/download
