Page: Auth & Login

Concept:
- Authenticate users and establish JWT-based sessions for REST and SignalR
- Enforce role-based access (Admin, Planner, Operator, Viewer) across pages

Accessible Functions:
- Login with credentials to obtain JWT access token
- Fetch current user profile/roles
- Logout (planned) and token invalidation

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): POST /api/v1/auth/login, GET /api/v1/auth/me
- REST (planned): POST /api/v1/auth/logout, /api/v1/admin/users/* (Admin-only)
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime (connect with access token)

Backend Communication:
- Sends credentials to login; receives access token; stores securely (e.g., memory + secure storage)
- Attaches Authorization: Bearer <token> to all REST requests
- Passes token on SignalR connect; authorization enforced on connect/group join and message delivery
- Role and allowedRobotIds filter UI controls and subscriptions per page
