Page: Simulation

Concept:
- Create production-like simulation sessions that mirror live behavior
- Run controls and visualize status/events/metrics

Accessible Functions:
- Create simulation session: choose map version; create N simulated robots with capabilities/feature flags; load missions/tasks
- Run controls: start, stop, pause, resume; adjust speed multiplier
- Visualization: same traffic and robot views as production; event timeline
- Outputs: throughput, average wait_time, congestion_penalty contributions; safety-stop counts (if simulated)

Endpoints Used:
- REST (implemented): POST /api/v1/sim/sessions, POST /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}/start, POST /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}/stop, POST /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}/pause, POST /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}/resume
- REST (planned): GET /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}, GET /api/v1/sim/sessions/{simSessionId}/metrics
- Realtime Hub: /hubs/realtime
- SignalR topics: sim.session.status, sim.event, sim.metrics.updated

Backend Communication:
- Auth via JWT; role-based access controls simulation management
- REST for session lifecycle; SignalR for status/events/metrics with initial snapshot
- Sim robots are isolated by runtimeMode=SIM; never mixed with live robots
