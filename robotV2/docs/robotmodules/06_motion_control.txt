MODULE 06: MOTION CONTROL (LINEAR VELOCITY ONLY)
========================================================

Goal:
- Convert targetLinearVel into safe actuator commands to the drive system
- Enforce acceleration/deceleration limits and safety stops

Primary Inputs:
- targetLinearVel from Traffic Adapter
- Motion limits from cfg.motion_limits
- Safety signals from Hardware Interface (radar/estop)

Primary Outputs:
- Drive motor setpoints (forward/backward)
- state.event updates:
  - currentLinearVel, motionState

Core Logic:
1) Clamp targetVel by maxDriveSpeed
2) Apply acceleration limiting:
   - currentVel approaches targetVel with maxAcceleration/maxDeceleration
3) Safety overrides:
   - obstacleDetected or estopActive -> targetVel=0 and hard stop
4) Report currentVel to StateStore for publishing

Cross-check with backendmodules:
- backendmodules/06_route_planner.txt uses motion limits for ETA.
- backendmodules/07_traffic_control_service.txt depends on robot feedback currentLinearVel.
