MODULE 08: TELEMETRY & STATUS REPORTING (PUBLISHER)
========================================================

Goal:
- Publish telemetry streams and logs without blocking motion

Primary Inputs:
- StateStore snapshots/events
- Hardware sensor data (battery, pose, radar, QR)
- Internal errors/exceptions

Primary Outputs (Robot -> Backend):
- state.snapshot (periodic)
- state.event (on change)
- telemetry.* (mixed frequency)
- log.event (errors and explanations)
- presence.hello and presence.heartbeat

Publishing Policy:
- High-rate telemetry (pose/motion) should be droppable if needed.
- Low-rate telemetry (battery/health) can be durable.
- Logs are durable suggested.

Presence:
- presence.hello:
  - robotId, softwareVersion, runtimeMode, capabilities, feature flags
- presence.heartbeat:
  - uptime, quick health summary

Cross-check with backendmodules:
- backendmodules/03_robot_registry_sessions.txt ingests presence.*.
- backendmodules/04_state_ingestion_store.txt ingests state/telemetry/logs and writes Timescale replay.
