UI/UX Design Architecture — Skylink Frontend (Modern & Clean Revision)

1. Design Philosophy: "Tech-Elegant & Focus-Driven"
- Core: A harmony of functional density and aesthetic minimalism.
- Vibe: Futuristic but grounded. Think "SpaceX Dashboard" meets "Linear.app".
- Principles:
  - Content-First: UI recedes; data stands out.
  - Fluidity: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions for every state change.
  - Depth: Use lighting and subtle borders rather than heavy drop shadows.

2. Theming System
- Mode: Dark mode first (Operational focus). Light mode as secondary.
- Palette (Tailwind v4 Clean Slate):
  - Background: Zinc-950 (Deep, neutral dark).
  - Surface: Zinc-900 with subtle transparency (95% opacity).
  - Primary: Violet-500 (Modern, vibrant but not aggressive).
  - Accent: Sky-400 (For data streams/active states).
  - Status:
    - Success: Emerald-400 (Glow effect allowed).
    - Warning: Amber-400.
    - Error: Rose-500.
- Gradients: Very subtle radial gradients to highlight active areas (e.g., top-left glow on active cards).

3. Typography
- Font: 'Inter' (or 'Geist Sans' if available) for UI; 'JetBrains Mono' for telemetry/code.
- Weights:
  - Headers: SemiBold (600) with tight tracking (-0.02em).
  - Body: Regular (400) with relaxed line-height (1.6).
  - Labels: Medium (500), uppercase, wide tracking (0.05em) for small caps.
- Hierarchy: rely on color opacity (text-white vs text-zinc-400) over size variance.

4. Layout & Spacing (The "Bento" Approach)
- Grid: 4px baseline.
- Structure: "Bento Grid" dashboard layouts—modular, resizable rectangular tiles.
- Gaps: Consistent 16px (compact) or 24px (relaxed) gaps.
- Radius:
  - Outer Windows: `rounded-3xl` (if framing content).
  - Cards/Panels: `rounded-2xl` (Modern standard).
  - Buttons/Inputs: `rounded-lg` or `rounded-full` (Pill shapes for actions).

5. Component Language
- App Shell:
  - Floating Dock or Sidebar: Detached from edges, glass effect (`backdrop-blur-md`, `bg-zinc-900/80`).
  - Header: Minimal, transparent with sticky blur.
- Cards (The "Glass" Surface):
  - Border: 1px solid `zinc-800`.
  - Background: `bg-zinc-900/60` (Glassmorphism allowed for depth).
  - Hover: `border-zinc-700` + subtle scale (1.01).
- Buttons:
  - Primary: Gradient background (Violet-600 to Indigo-600), white text, subtle shadow glow.
  - Secondary: Surface color, border `zinc-700`, hover text-white.
  - Ghost: Text only, hover `bg-zinc-800/50`.
- Inputs:
  - Background: `bg-zinc-950`.
  - Border: `zinc-800` (focus ring: `ring-2 ring-violet-500/20`).
  - No default heavy outlines; use glow for focus.

6. Visualization & Telemetry
- Charts:
  - Thin lines (1.5px).
  - Gradient fills (fade to transparent).
  - Minimal axes (hide grid lines where possible).
- Maps:
  - Custom dark theme (desaturated).
  - Markers: Pulsing dots for active robots.
  - Controls: Floating glass pills on map corners.

7. Interaction & Motion
- Speed: Snappy (150ms-200ms).
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` (Spring-like, smooth).
- Feedback:
  - Click: Active scale down (0.98).
  - Hover: Lift or brightness increase.
- Skeleton Loading: Shimmer effects for data fetching; never show blank screens.

8. Accessibility & Clarity
- Contrast: Ensure 4.5:1 for text.
- Focus: Visible focus rings (Indigo/Violet glow) for keyboard nav.
- Reduced Motion: Respect user preferences for animation.

9. Navigation Structure
- Sidebar (Icon-first, expandable on hover):
  - [Grid] Dashboard
  - [Cpu] Robot Status
  - [Map] Map View
  - [Play] Simulation
  - [Joystick] Manual Control
  - [List] Mission Plan
- Breadcrumbs: Minimal, slash-separated.

10. Future-Proofing
- Tech: React Server Components (RSC) where possible.
- State: URL-driven state for shareable views.
- Icons: Lucide React (Clean, consistent stroke width 1.5px).

This architecture pushes for a "Modern SaaS" feel—clean lines, depth through blur/borders, and high-quality typography—while maintaining the utility needed for robotics control.
